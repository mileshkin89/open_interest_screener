config.py

This module defines application-level configuration using `pydantic-settings` for type-safe
and flexible environment-based settings.

Environment variables are loaded from a `.env` file at startup using `python-dotenv`.
Useful constants such as database and log file paths are also defined here.

Usage:
    from config import config
    print(config.TG_BOT_API_KEY)
