scanner.py

Module that defines the Scanner class, which periodically fetches market data from different
exchanges via listeners, checks for trading signals using given conditions, and triggers
notifications when such signals occur.

The scanner:
- Initializes database and trims outdated data.
- Fetches up-to-date USDT trading pairs for each exchange.
- Periodically checks conditions using a condition handler.
- Sends notifications through a callback when signals are found.

Classes:
    Scanner: Manages periodic market scanning and signal detection per user.

Requires:
    - Initialized `ListenerManager` and `ConditionHandler` instances.
    - Asynchronous environment for continuous execution.

        Runs the scanner loop to detect signals and notify the user if any are found.

        This method:
            - Initializes the database on the first run.
            - Cleans up old signal data once per day.
            - Refreshes the list of symbols for each active exchange daily.
            - Every fixed interval (e.g., 5 minutes), checks for signals.

            user_id (int): Telegram user ID to whom the alerts will be sent.
            notify_callback (Callable): Async function used to send signal messages to the user.
            threshold_period (int, optional): Time period to measure open interest change. Defaults to config value.
            threshold (float, optional): Minimum open interest change (in percent) to trigger a signal. Defaults to config value.
